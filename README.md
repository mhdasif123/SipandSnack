This application is pre-configured for deployment on **Firebase App Hosting**.

To deploy your application:

1.  **Create a Firebase Project**: If you don't have one already, go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Enable App Hosting**: Within your new Firebase project, navigate to the App Hosting section and create a new backend.
